1. What is webpack ?

    A tool to pack JavaScript program in the better deployable form.     <--- ***


2. In early 2000s, Whenever requested new HTML to change display,
   It only could be done by refreshing screen.

   - This time, JavaScript simply plays a role in binding DOM.
   - Thus, JavaScript files are small.
   - But To make a website in way of SPA (= Single Page Application),
     JavaScript files per a page get more bigger than before.
     Thus, JavaScript files are *NOT* manageable any more.

     Order of JavaScript file's declaration more complicated, 
     because of dependencies between JavaScript files.
     Global variables overwritings become also problems.


3. JavaScript supports "module system" since "ES6" in language.         <--- ***

    - All mordern web browsers supports ES6 module system (ESM).
    - Old web browsers cannot use JavaScript module system.             <--- ***
    - And a number of "JavaScript Open Sources" are *NOT* made
      in form of ES6 module system.                                     <--- ***

    a. Representational JavaScript Module System is "CommonJS".         <--- ***
    b. Other JavaScript Module System is "ESM"(= ES6 Module System)     <--- ***


4. "Node.JS" follows "CommonJS" Module System Standard, 
   Then, The "CommonJS" spreads broadly.

    - Thus, A number of JavaScript Open Sources are implemented
      by "CommonJS" module system.                                      <--- ***


5. "Webpack" supports both "ESM"(= ES6 Module System) and "CommonJS.    <--- ***

    - If making codes using "module system" and running "Webpack",
      JavaScript codes could be made runnable in old web browsers.      <--- ***

    - Running "Webpack", one JavaScript file made generally             <--- ***
      or one JavaScript file could be divided into several files.

    - All we have to do is include JavaScript files made by "Webpack"
      into "<script>" tag in HTML.                                      <--- ***
      

6. How to use "Webpack" ?

    (1) Create "package.json" file by "npm" command

        > npm init -y                                                   <--- ***

    (2) Install ① webpack ② webpack-cli ③ react ④ react-dom packages by "npm" command

        > npm i [ -S | --save ] webpack webpack-cli react@16.14.0 react-dom@16.14.0   <--- ***
        > npm ls --depth=0
        > npm webpack -v                                                <--- ***

    (3) Merge two JavaScript files into *One* JavaScript file by "webpack",
        then "main.js" made.

        > npx webpack --mode { development | production }               <--- ***

    (4) Check whether the following file exists:

        ./dist/main.js

    (5) HTML file uses the above "dist/main.js".                        <--- ***
