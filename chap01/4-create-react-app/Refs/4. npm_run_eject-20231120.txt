    1st. method: Fork "react-scripts", and create a configuration on my own.

    2nd. method: Use "react-app-rewired" package.
        - Tweak the "create-react-app" "webpack" config(s) without using 'eject' 
          and without creating a "fork" of the "react-scripts".

            > npm show react-app-rewired
            > npm home react-app-rewired
